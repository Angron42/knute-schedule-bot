# A Few Ways to Get Your University's MKR API URL

## 1. Using mkr.org.ua api
Actually, I still don't know how to get the list from mkr.org.ua api.<br>
This method uses their mobile app, but I don't know exactly how,<br>
so I used the method below

## 2. Using the MKR schedule mobile app

### To do this, you will need the following apps:
* MKR schedule - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mkr.shedule_app
* Any packet capture app, I use PCAPdroid - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emanuelef.remote_capture

To get started, make sure you have selected the timetable for your university in the MKR app.<br>
It will also be useful to add MKR to the filter in the packet capture app as in screenshot 1, to avoid confusion.<br>
We don't need SSL decryption.

### Getting started
1. Run a packet capture
2. Go to the MKR App
3. Return to the packet capture application and stop it

After we exited the MKR application and stopped capturing, we received the required data, as in screenshot 2.
### This is our URL.
